# Neural-Network
Very Basic Neural Network
This project contains a very basic implementation of 1 Layered Neural Network which works on three input features x1,x2,x3, but only x3 
values determines the output.
Firstly we set random weights for synapses and later after training we show that predicted output also depends only on value of x3.

This code can be used as a tutorial which shows a working Neural Network and help in understanding back-prop and forward-prop.
